This repository is for C and C++ projects that I have written for mostly my Data Structures and Algorithms and Programming Languages courses assignments. Also there are some simple console games that I wrote in my first semester as a Computer Science and Engineering student. Currently this repository includes:

1- A simple search engine implemented with template linkedlists

2- A spiral search of wanted words in a matrix type text file

3- A simple compressing algorithm for text files based on The Lempel-Ziv Compressing Algorithm

4- A simple scanner and parser structure for C programming language

5- A simple console snake game

6- 2048 in console
