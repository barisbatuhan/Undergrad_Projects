* This application requires Java 9 for a proper working experience.

- **A summary of what can be done through this application**:
* Important information of candidates can be seen from GUI directly
* If the candidates have their CVs in the system, it can be shown through the application.
* A new candidate can be added to the storage

* Multiple persons can be added at once.

- **In Version 1.4**:
* Basic CV presentation is added to the GUI. If there is a CV added for that person in the database, then it will be shown.
* Integration tests are written for filtering, also some additions and improvements in unit tests implemented.
