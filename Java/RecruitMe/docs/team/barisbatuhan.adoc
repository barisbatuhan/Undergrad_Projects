== PROJECT: Recruit Me

---

== Overview

Recruit Me is a Java Desktop GUI application that is specifically designed for a recruiting agency for their processes about the candidates in their storage.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *filtering command*
** *What it does:*
*** Filters the persons according to their every single aspect (Name, Phone, Email, Skills, ...)
*** Can manage multiple filtering at the same time and also the filter can be cleared in any time the user wants.
*** Filtering command has 4 different branches in itself: `AND, OR, REVERSE, CLEAR` (For detailed explanation, please read filtering part in UserGuide).
** *Justification:* This feature improves the usability of the product significantly, because it can eliminate all the candidates that are not fitting for the wanted job positions. Makes classification and searching easier.
** *Highlights:* This new feature affects all the commands already implemented and all other commands that will be implemented in the future. Thus, the interaction of this command with other commands are strongly investigated and minor changes for other commands are also made to make the other commands compatible with filtering.
